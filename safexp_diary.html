          <p>The call went out, it’s time! We are boarding. So excited!</p>

          <p>Once again, I don't think I have words.</p>
          <p>We are at the Fallen Capsuleer Memorial, which is a graveyard. This golden pod, held up by golden statues, on top of a forever burning light and three black arching monoliths.</p>
          <p>It’s strange: we always see Capsuleers as immortals and yet, they built a Memorial for those of them who passed away.</p>
          <p>They can die.</p>

          <p>Just as it happened with the Iyen-Oursta Monument, this stop was also one of silence and contemplation. If the previous one had been a battlefield, this one was about the mortality of man, the mortality of Capsuleers. Those pilots were thought to be immortal, dying and reviving again and again, till the end of New Eden, and yet, they could die, forever. In the long run death united everyone, gods and mortals.</p>
          <p>As the shuttle turned and headed back on the way they had come, they entered the longest leg of the whole trip. Guests relaxed and chatted, some napped, but soon enough, dinner came. Once again, the chef had worked hard to build a set of dishes that complemented their voyage, mixing together cuisines and tastes, making the dining experience just as good and particular as the sights outside the viewports.</p>
          <p>Outside the shuttle, all the hues of New Eden passed by: gold and red, green and blue. The longest leg was also the sum of all the other parts, carrying them backwards through each and every Empire.</p>
          <p>The closer the shuttle got to Jita, the greater the traffic become. The waits at the gates lengthened but also came the realization that their voyage was soon to end. Jita 4-4 appeared on the horizon and that was their arrival station.</p>

          <p>Anyway!</p>
          <p>It’s ending… already… Ah!</p>
          <p>Yes, we are in sight of Jita 4-4. Seen from outside the station is even more impressive: it’s massive but even more massive is the traffic. So many ships, from small shuttles to massive Capsuleers’ cargo ships. I hope one of those doesn’t crush us by mistake!</p>
          <p>I’m sad… cause it’s ended.</p>
          <p>What to say: the sights are oh so worth it. You’re pampered as it’s clearly a first class service and Alena, the host, actually seems to know what she is talking about and not repeating something she had learned by memory.</p>
          <p>Would I do it again? I’d say yes.</p>
          <p>However, right now… I’m tempted by the Mild Thrill experience. I have to give it a thought.</p>
