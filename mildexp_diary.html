The hull was a Caldari standard design, but it had been modified by Sawa Laboratories crews to provide a better view from the passengers’ compartment with floor to ceiling viewports, extra comfort seats and advanced projector technology. The livery was dark but for a pair of orange stripes, inconspicuous and simple.</p>

          <p>Once everyone was on board and the ship was sealed, the shuttle began its undocking operations. It slowly rose from its berth before it headed for the busy access corridor. The movements were smooth and the guests barely felt the change of vibrations under their feet.</p>

          <p>The shuttle sped through system after system, the green hues soon giving space to the golden tints of Genesis. It only paused for a brief moment in Imiya, just before heading into the Monalaz constellation.</p>

          <p>A view like none in all New Eden. There were many monuments but there was only one EVE Gate. The guests were in awe as soon as they entered the system and their awe only grew as they sat in the quietness of space, not far from the Sisters of EVE Research station. The EVE Gate filled the viewports completely, it shed light like no other star and everyone felt the weight of it all. The EVE Gate.</p>
          <p>The shuttle hung a little longer around the EVE Gate, letting the guests enjoy the sight, as the system was quiet and there was no rush. When everyone’s eyes were full of the flowing light, then and only then, the shuttle headed for the way it had come, warping toward the Promised Land system.</p>
          <p>Refreshments were once again served and the excitement grew more subdued as the light of the EVE Gate faded and became a memory. More than a few of guests held their breath as they briefly crossed a few system with below 0 security status but the crossing was smooth and uneventful.</p>

          <p>Below 0! We went below 0! Only for a few systems but we went below 0 sec. Anything happened? Not really. It was cool and quiet.</p>
          <p>So much purple!</p>
          <p>It’s like a huge purple streak in the sky with a few scattered blue dots in there. And apparently it’s a field of black holes! But whatever it is, it looks… unique and cool.</p>

          <p>The shuttle landed a few kilometres from the research installation and cruised silently past it, letting the guests enjoys an unbroken sight of such unique cosmic anomaly.</p>
          <p>As the shuttle turned and headed back on the way they had come, they entered the longest leg of the whole trip. Guests relaxed and chatted, some napped, but soon enough, dinner came. Once again, the chef had worked hard to build a set of dishes that complemented their voyage, mixing together cuisines and tastes, making the dining experience just as good and particular as the sights outside the viewports.</p>
          <p>Outside the shuttle, the hues of New Eden replayed backwards: green and gold, green and blue. The longest leg was also the sum of all the other parts, carrying them backwards through the same regions they had passed through on their way forward.</p>
          <p>The closer the shuttle got to Jita, the greater the traffic become. The waits at the gates lengthened but also came the realisation that their voyage was soon to end. Jita 4-4 appeared on the horizon and that was their arrival station.</p>

          <p>Already. Boooo.</p>   
          <p>Not the first time anymore but Jita 4-4 and its traffic is still impressive.</p>
          <p>What to say? They are two different experiences. The Safe Thrill is truly relaxing, you fly around New Eden, eat great food and chill. This one keeps you on the edge of the seat much more, we saw pirates at a few hundred kilometres from us! We were so close! But otherwise, it felt safe, we didn’t encounter much traffic once we left are around Jita.</p>
          <p>The food was once again great.</p>
          <p>I would say I would do it again, if nothing else to visit the EVE Gate again. But I would like to stay at the Sister’s of EvE station for a few days, to contemplate it.</p>   
          <p>I was told they have a Maximum Thrill Experience but that might be out of my league. I’ll give it a thought but no promises.</p>
