          <p>Born in the temperate landscape of Osaumuni V, she soon proved to be a gifted and curious girl. She moved to Rens to pursue Stellar physic at the University of Rens III before moving on to specialize in Wormhole physic.</p>
          <p>After graduating, she was visiting researcher at The Sanctuary, the research branch of the Sisters of EvE where she continued her studies on wormholes.

The hull was a Caldari standard design, but it had been modified by Sawa Laboratories crews to provide a better view from the passengers’ compartment with floor to ceiling viewports, extra comfort seats and advanced projector technology. The livery was dark but for a pair of orange stripes, inconspicuous and simple.</p>

          <p>This is the last one, you heard me?! One last thrill so my spirit can be happy I did them all but then I want a long boring vacation on Alentene III, okay?</p>
          <p>I’m once again boarding a New Eden Voyages shuttle, this time the NEV Voyager III. I just hope the “III” doesn’t mean the two before mine had died. This time, however, we are diving into wormhole space, also known as Anoikis. And I’m frightened for real this time.</p>

          <p>Once everyone was on board and the ship was sealed, the shuttle began its undocking operations. It slowly rose from its berth before it headed for the busy access corridor. The movements were smooth and the guests barely felt the change of vibrations under their feet.</p>
          <p>Refreshments were distributed but not so many gasped and turned in awe as they exited the massive station. This voyage was for the people that had seen Jita 4-4 before, the gasps and thrills laid ahead of them. Nonetheless, the shuttle was right in the thick of the crowded space around Jita 4-4: massive ships, from cargo to battle ones, loomed as it sped away, heading for the Perimeter gate.</p>
          <p>The shuttle headed for Uitra, only a smatter of jumps from Jita, and once there, it headed for a spot in deep space. Then and only then, once everyone had taken a deep breath, the shuttle activated the filament that catapulted it into Triglavian space.</p>

          <p>Wormholes are scary, that they are. These systems hanging somewhere nowhere… let’s hope to not fall through. But somewhat… mesmerizing as well? They swirl and twitch slowly, hanging there, in space. They hint of what you might find on the other side and yet they remain secretive of what truly lies on the other side. The only way to know is to go all in…</p>
          <p>Thera. It’s… massive, Taivi said 342 AU which she said it’s a lot. And it’s unique. Okay, I know, I said unique a lot of times during these trips but how can I say it differently? I haven’t seen anything like Thera before.</p>
          <p>It has a soft, pearl like background disappearing into the darkness with a fiery star in the center.

Wormhole after wormhole, the space around them swirled, twisted, blinked and without even knowing it, they were back into known space. Just like that. Anoikis was behind them, hidden behind the liquid, swirling pool of the wormhole.</p>
          <p>Many breathed easier now. Wormhole space was a different kind of space. You knew what you could find in Null Security space, but in Anoikis, there really was no telling on what could appear from the emptiness of space or what could lay in wait on the other side of a wormhole.</p>

          <p>Anoikis space is… different. They are so far away and so difficult to reach that the rules we take for granted in known space don’t work. Yet, they have a beauty to it, a dangerous one, but no less a beauty.</p>
          <p>The enemies are also different, capsuleers but those aliens as well, the Sleepers, as they are called. And apparently more could be lurking into the depths of space between spaces.</p>

        <p>"<i>Dear guests, we are nearing Jita 4-4. As you can see, the traffic around the greatest station of the whole cluster is thick. Jita 4-4 is renowed as the main market hub and, as such, it attracts people from all over New Eden.</i>"</p>
        <p>"<i>In its corridor, you will be able to find the most faithful of Amarrian side by side with the flashiest Gallente. Caldari business man trading with Minmatar clan representatives and through it all, the capsuleers, immortals in a mortal world. Not for nothing, Jita 4-4 is sometimes called the beating heart of New Eden.</i>"</p>
        <p>"<i>As we enter the station itself, I am sad to announce that we are at the end of our Voyage. We hope you had a pleasant Voyage and New Eden Voyages hopes to see you again soon.</i>"</p>
