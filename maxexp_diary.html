The hull was a Caldari standard design, but it had been modified by Sawa Laboratories crews to provide a better view from the passengers’ compartment with floor to ceiling viewports, extra comfort seats and advanced projector technology. The livery was dark but for a pair of orange stripes, inconspicuous and simple.</p>

          <p>Once everyone was on board and the ship was sealed, the shuttle began its undocking operations. It slowly rose from its berth before it headed for the busy access corridor. The movements were smooth and the guests barely felt the change of vibrations under their feet.</p>
          <p>Refreshments were distributed but not so many gasped and turned in awe as they exited the massive station. This voyage was for the people that had seen Jita 4-4 before, the gasps and thrills laid ahead of them. Nonetheless, the shuttle was right in the thick of the crowded space around Jita 4-4: massive ships, from cargo to battle ones, loomed as it sped away, heading for the Perimeter gate.</p>

          <p>The shuttle lined up toward the next gate but lingered, letting the guests fully take in the spectacle of the Cord of Elements.  They were in a pocket of calm and, after that stop, there would be no turning point. They would head into the depths of Null Security space, heading south, then east to end in the far north, for an experience like no other.</p>
          <p>When the time to linger was past, the shuttle sped toward the 3-IN0V gate. A few jumps and they headed into Cloud Ring, home of the ORE Corporation. Refreshments were served as Fountain passed by. Delve was coming closer and closer. They encountered a fleet, a mix of frigates and destroyers hanging on a gate, but the shuttle was quick to depart, M2-XFE was waiting.</p>

          <p>It’s… chilling how capsuleers can throw so many resources into holding a single point in space. And the outcome? In doubt.</p>
          <p>And to think that so many crews got spent out here, away from everyone, fighting in a war of the gods. In moments like these capsuleers do feel like gods, capricious and yet infinitely powerful.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine how people on those ships must have felt, jumping into the fire of doomsdays, knowing they were probably already doomed, even before entering the fray.</p>

          <p>A full meal was served and this time, the starred Chef went to mix the cuisine of Delve, reminiscing of its Amarrian roots, with the edgy and experimental tastes of a place like Stain, where the Empires were far away and the life was twisted in new directions.</p>
          <p>The shuttle bounced between Delve and Querious, then it headed south toward Period Basis before entering Stain. It didn’t take long to see the spiked ship of the Sanshas hanging on gates and guarding stations. This was the nation of the Sansha.</p>

Physically smaller, yes, but not less small in terms of what had happened and what had been lost.</p>
          <p>Once the time was up, the shuttle headed for the X-7BIX gate. They were halfway through the Voyage but much was yet to be traveled. They had reached the southern point of their Voyage and now it was time to head further east.</p>
          <p>To ease the underlying stress that ran through the guests, the crew was quick to serve another full meal. This time, the starred chef chose to play with what they had left, touching on the refined Syndicate cuisine and the Delve bloody one, and with what they had in front of them, touching on the Insmother remoteness cuisine and the lawlessness cuisine of pirate infested Venal.</p>
          <p>It was a relaxing moment as, outside, they moved from the dusty, rusty colors of Esoteria into the green sea of Immensea.</p>

          <p>The Titanomachy was a debris field littered with titans and bathed in the sun of the far away star. As such, the shuttle didn’t get too close, least to endanger its guests. It hovered a safe distance away, once again relying on projector technology and camera drones to give the impression to cruise right in the middle of those giant husks of once powerful ships.</p>
          <p>Once the time was up, the shuttle aligned toward the O3Z5-G gate and entered another leg of the trip. As they headed for the eastern point of the Experience, they passed through Catch, Curse where they saw a few Angel Cartel pirates on traffic control duty, Scalding Pass, a quick fly by in Wicked Creek before they entered Insmother.</p>

          <p>It was time for a full meal as much as for a rest. The starred chef chose to play with the contrast of southern and northern cuisine, bridging them with the eastern touches that spoke of remoteness, of Caldari grey and Minmatar rusty brown.</p>
          <p>Many guests choose to rest once the meal was done. They hadn’t moved from the passenger compartment and yet, the long journey, as much as the lingering fear of Null Security space, took its toll. The shuttle sped north, past massive capsuleer stations and empty systems. Up north, toward Tenal and the crazy Gurista pirates.</p>

          <p>Not everyone could relax, they were still cruising through dangerous territory but the last full meal of the Voyage distracted many guests. The chef had worked hard to build an experience of cuisine that called for the remoteness of Tenal, the rebelliousness of Venal and the frontieresque of Tribute.

          <p>When they crossed back into High Security space, jumping into Oimmo, many took a breath of relief. They had done it: they had dived into Null Security space, resurfaced and got out alive. What an experience to boast with friends and relatives.</p>

          <p>I felt like I faced death right there and then those pair of times. Those gatecamps looked nasty and I feel like some unknown god up there, I don’t know if it’s the Amarr one or another one, looked down at us. We are so small and yet, we managed to get through with only a pair of close call. I consider myself lucky.</p>
          <p>And then the loki… I totally felt like it tried to tail us but probably it was just on its way to its own things. Also, those Muninns out there… happy to have seen them from afar. Just as I’m happy to have seen the Sansha guys from very well afar (Those looked nastier than gatecamps if that’s possible). Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>In the end, relieved to be alive, I say that this is an experience not for the faint of heart. I’m sure it’s made in a way that we get close to death but we don’t die, but it still feels like we are risking it at every jump.</p>
          <p>Not sure I would do it again… I have a soft heart, you know!</p>
